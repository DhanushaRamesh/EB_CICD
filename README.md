# EB_CICD
CI/CD Pipeline to Deploy NodeJS Code to Elastic Beanstalk                                                 

## Getting Started
#### We are going to deploy few updates to running Elastic Beanstalk application using CICD pipeline.
  1. Create a new Elastic Beanstalk application with sample Node JS code. Follow the instructions in the file create_EB_env.pdf for reference.
  2. Create the CICD pipeline as instructed in the CICD.md file.
  3. New updates are launched into the Elastic Beanstalk environment once the CICD is successful.
